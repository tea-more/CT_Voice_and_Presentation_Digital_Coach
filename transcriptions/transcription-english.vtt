00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:11.750
Hello how's it going?

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.740
Everybody has joined early.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.750
I want to be setting up my adjusting

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.200
things.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.740
Looks like my lighting is terrible.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.190
Hello and welcome everybody.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.100
Welcome everybody to CS-450 were also

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.940
crossed the certain number of other

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.960
departments.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.020
Yeah, so today I want to go through

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.550
some administrative things to tell you

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.190
a little bit about the course as well

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.010
as get started with the first lecture.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.350
Please let me know if there is any

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.090
technical issues in terms of hearing me

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:19.030
or otherwise.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.930
Guarantee that there will be lots of

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:21.800
technical issues throughout the

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.270
semester.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.940
But will try to do our best to deliver

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.570
the course as it is kind of usually OK.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.740
Let me start by perhaps sharing screen

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.900
and taking you through a little bit of

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:36.700
the web page.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.055
I am telling you a bit about the

00:15:40.055 --> 00:15:43.000
course, so this is the relate webpage.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.410
So relate is a course web system design

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.590
primarily by Andreas Kloeckner, who is

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:52.680
a set of computing faculty here in

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.068
computer science, and it's it was

00:15:55.068 --> 00:15:56.760
designed with kind of actually numerics

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.570
courses in mind.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.105
So it was designed for this type of

00:15:59.105 --> 00:16:00.614
course, and it's extremely convenient,

00:16:00.614 --> 00:16:03.050
so all of the assignments will be doing

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.860
and actually even your exams will be

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.490
through relate and all information.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.730
Will be posted here so I see someone

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:11.150
more taps here because I'm going to

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.020
structure then you guys do.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.330
You should see like participant in

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:13.860
grading.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:17.260
Maybe probably not content but

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:17.690
innocence.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:21.890
All assignments will be here and OK.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.380
Let me return to the types of

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:23.610
assignments.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.040
Will have the other thing you want to

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.260
definitely make use of this piaza and

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.360
some things will be will be actually

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.310
another computer.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:32.420
For example, for example.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:33.710
Typically when like exam grades come

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:35.540
out, that's analysen Piazza.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:36.840


00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.180
So keep an eye out on and also any

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.920
questions you have please post there

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.650
including my questions for core staff

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.450
that are kind of personal, such as if

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:45.870
you want an exception for something.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.650
I would encourage you to use Piazza

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.380
private messages for and send it to all

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.680
instructors, not just to me, so that GS

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.800
might also be able to help out with

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.440
your request.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.140
Yeah, so kind of process is better than

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:00.570
email.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:01.810
Essentially in all cases because it

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.630
gives us a centralized way to keep

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:04.912
track of questions.

00:17:04.912 --> 00:17:06.510
And while private questions are good

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.240
for kind of personal things, I would

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.689
encourage you to ask questions kind of

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:14.315
publicly and so that other students can

00:17:14.315 --> 00:17:17.730
also answer and also see answers if

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.330
you're actually asking about technical

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:19.645
content.

00:17:19.645 --> 00:17:21.990
So whether it be about the lectures or

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:23.110
about a homework quiz.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.680
Courage to make it kind of a public

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.320
question.

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.710
You generally shouldn't actually share

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.267
like your code, period, so we're kind

00:17:32.267 --> 00:17:34.326
of ask for such specific help, but

00:17:34.326 --> 00:17:37.010
we're generally going to be kind of

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.910
happy to give you feedback and hints on

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.830
questions and stuff like that, provided

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.180
that the question kind of shows some

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:43.950
level understanding.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:48.765
So in terms of the course, so it's kind

00:17:48.765 --> 00:17:50.720
of structured into chapters which are

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.170
derived from a book by Mike Heath.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.640
My Keith is a professor emeritus here,

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.760
and Mike is kind of responsible for the

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.300
original design of the course, as well

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.190
as having having written a textbook and

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.090
lecture notes for this course.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.930
So I actually my day learned took this

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.560
course as an undergraduate here and

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.080
kind of learn much of it through Mikes

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.150
notes.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:15.920
That didn't stop me, however, from once

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.110
I got here of creating my own notes,

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.020
which are a bit different, in large

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:20.680
part because.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:22.560
Kind of both.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.270
One way I try to lecture is by actually

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.810
writing things out as opposed to

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.500
working with slides in the background.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.930
And this is this kind of forces things

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.760
to go a little slower as well as gives

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.060
time to kind of show derivations which

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.380
are very difficult to understand from a

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:37.760
slide.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.820
My lecture notes also include some

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.500
additional things, although the Mikes

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.020
notes will include things that might do

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.310
not give you just a quick example,

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.800
let's see.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:51.489
These are my case notes and they

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.910
essentially you can read this almost

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:54.496
like a textbook.

00:18:54.496 --> 00:18:56.910
So kind of there quite complete and I'm

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.820
very precise and they contain basically

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.090
no mistakes, so I iterations of

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:02.770
teaching this course.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.555
Nobody has reported mistakenly slides.

00:19:04.555 --> 00:19:06.380
My slides will certainly contain some

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.580
mistakes because they're relatively

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.290
new, but these have kind of seen many

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:13.220
rounds of many iterations of the

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.990
course, so there are well developed,

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:16.060
very well organized.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.230
And a great reference.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:24.810
My notes provide some kind of

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:26.060
additional stuff, and they're also just

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:26.889
different, so it's a different

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.520
perspective on many of the same things,

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.580
and in some cases I made use of what

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.290
Mike actually has in his sights.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:34.930
For example, he has a background very

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:36.850
similar to this, while in other cases

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:37.930
I'll actually have insights and

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.010
analysis that Mike doesn't cover.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.320
But the topics are actually fairly well

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.375
defined and aren't too different, and

00:19:45.375 --> 00:19:47.310
in fact you can also find lecture notes

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:48.470
from previous instructors for the

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.980
course.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.510
So Andreas Klockner in particular has

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.156
developed his own set of notes as well,

00:19:52.156 --> 00:19:55.050
and so if you want multiple, I would

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:56.720
encourage you to look at all of those.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.480
You might also be able to find videos

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.060
of.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.720
Lectures by Andreas and possibly by

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.340
Mike, but I'm not sure actually about

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.970
how widely available letters of

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.360
previous iterations of the course.

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.486
If you're interested in kind of

00:20:12.486 --> 00:20:13.760
actually following a different

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.920
structure through the same content.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.460
So this kind of course outline will

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.190
contain not just the notes, so also it

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:23.310
contains a writing template.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.260
So as will go through.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.970
I'll be kind of writing in on a blank

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:29.850
version of these notes, and so if you

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.285
want to follow along and take notes,

00:20:31.285 --> 00:20:34.040
you can also use these, and for each

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.510
one of these should be available.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:37.976
If you click this little triangle in

00:20:37.976 --> 00:20:38.349
outline.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.395
Similarly, throughout the class will in

00:20:42.395 --> 00:20:44.430
class go through some demos, although

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:45.890
not necessarily all of the demos that

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:46.900
you see here.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.890
These demos are primarily have

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:50.220
primarily been developed by Andres

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.450
cleaner, but also the contribution,

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.540
something from Luke and some for

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:52.990
myself.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.200
And you can kind of just click list to

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.980
view the demo as an HTML page, but you

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.250
can't actually run anything.

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.870
You can also download the Python script

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.410
or the Jupiter notebook and run it with

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:03.830
Python.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:05.495
So Speaking of Python, everything in

00:21:05.495 --> 00:21:08.050
this course will be Python based and

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:09.780
there is at the very end here some

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.450
resources about kind of generally

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:14.815
learning about Python.

00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:18.415
Python is an easy language to learn if

00:21:18.415 --> 00:21:19.940
you kind of have programming

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.490
experience, which I just ate in this

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.000
class is pretty much everybody has

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:23.410
some.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.322
And it's fairly convenient for it's

00:21:26.322 --> 00:21:27.490
convenient for numerics.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.610
And that kind of you should generally

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:32.950
be able to learn as we go along.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:36.020
Kind of the initial things will do with

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.730
Python are fairly basic.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.680
But and they kind of primarily look

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.570
like linear algebra.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:45.410
So actually I think I'm understanding

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.970
the syntax of the code will usually not

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:49.610
be the challenge for folks in this

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:50.380
course course.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.600
We're not really doing too much

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.570
complicated in terms of data

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.322
structures, but we are doing kind of

00:21:55.322 --> 00:21:56.892
mathematics with code, and the

00:21:56.892 --> 00:21:58.480
mathematics is always offering the hard

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:58.740
part.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.680
OK, more about that right?

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.295
So in terms of actually writing Python

00:22:04.295 --> 00:22:06.640
code, this is where relate is really

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.112
helpful.

00:22:07.112 --> 00:22:09.949
So actually through relate you can

00:22:09.949 --> 00:22:12.787
develop Python code through the browser

00:22:12.787 --> 00:22:14.530
and it actually even provides you

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:15.470
different types of editors.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.030
So if you use something like them or

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.830
Emacs, you can actually use that type

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.308
of syntax and develop a kind of the

00:22:21.308 --> 00:22:22.199
code through the browser.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.375
Then you can submit the code to get

00:22:24.375 --> 00:22:27.060
feedback on the results and get some

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:27.960
amount of feedback.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:32.140
As well as kind of keeps admitting that

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.240
until you get all the credit and then

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.150
actually finally submit your

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:34.640
assignment.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.580
So generally will have some such coding

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:39.049
questions on homeworks and there will

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:41.550
be will plan to have especially BI

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:42.930
Weekly Homeworks, although will skip

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.200
weeks on which there is exams, which is

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.170
something we haven't done in past

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.080
semesters but trying to reduce the load

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:48.920
this semester of it.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:52.990
So will also have quizzes and the

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:56.590
quizzes are going to be due by Electro

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:59.190
time for central every lecture unless

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.560
there is an example and or possibly if

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.350
there's something else too.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.270
Maybe we'll skip it.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.859
These quizzes are intended to kind of

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.470
keep everybody on track with what's

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:09.660
going on and to provide some kind of

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.960
questions to work through after each

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:12.330
lecture.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.370
And I thought about what weather to

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:17.800
modify this in light of the fact that

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.260
the word teaching remotely and there's

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.390
a pandemic going on.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.080
But I actually think that the structure

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.620
of these ad is valuable.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.990
So I think what will do is that just to

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:27.900
try to make them a little bit kind of

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.054
easier than in the past.

00:23:29.054 --> 00:23:30.970
In the past, we've had these.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.990
Typically how 1 short code coding

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.213
question at the end I'm thinking of not

00:23:35.213 --> 00:23:36.707
having essentially any coding questions

00:23:36.707 --> 00:23:38.395
and also not having any questions on

00:23:38.395 --> 00:23:41.500
the exams, but this is maybe not final.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.386
Maybe will sneak in some easy coding

00:23:43.386 --> 00:23:43.789
questions.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:46.700
Because they do kind of offer value

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.420
that otherwise it multiple choice

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:48.790
questions.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:51.010
It's hard to sometimes capture.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:53.160
But kind of, that's one of the ways in

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.690
which I'm going to try to make this

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:55.970
semester a little bit later.

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:59.400
While still, however, trying to kind of

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.830
maintain the content of the course

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.520
usually delivers as well as the kind of

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.990
regular evaluations that provides,

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:06.030
because I think they're actually very

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.470
valuable for students to kind of know

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:11.160
that they're spaced kind of staying on

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:11.850
top, of course.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.470
OK.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.560
Other things about the course, yeah, so

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.530
there's already a quiz due for the next

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:21.290
lecture on Wednesday.

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:22.843
This quiz is just about the course

00:24:22.843 --> 00:24:24.030
policies, so I'd encourage you to take

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:25.956
a quick look and then complete the

00:24:25.956 --> 00:24:26.519
policies.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:29.124
They talk about things like the kind of

00:24:29.124 --> 00:24:30.170
late homework submission.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.430
So for both quizzes and for homework so

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.620
you can submit them a few days late and

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:36.660
receive partial credit.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:41.090
In particular 50% credit if you for any

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.182
reason you kind of were unable to

00:24:43.182 --> 00:24:45.340
complete the quiz or homework on time,

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.270
or especially if you foresee.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.680
Being unable to complete it, let us

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.080
know and we'll find a way to give you

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.280
extra time.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.220
This semester will be more flexible

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:55.680
than previous semesters for all the

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.320
obvious reasons.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.800
However, if you kind of.

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:00.876
Ask us a week after the exam.

00:25:00.876 --> 00:25:02.470
With that, you kind of missed exam.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:04.110
We probably can't help with something

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.259
like that, so there's still kind of a

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:06.670
limit to just how much we can do.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.380
I see maybe question in the chat, how

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.550
long will each quiz typically take so

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:14.420
each quiz?

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.260
Should.

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:19.820
The issue it's not intended to take

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.560
long, it's just going to be multiple

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.350
choice questions, but you might run

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:24.642
into questions that force you to go

00:25:24.642 --> 00:25:26.340
back and look at the lecture notes and

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:27.690
kind of thing.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:29.776
So it might vary, but the intention is

00:25:29.776 --> 00:25:31.540
that kind of they should be less than

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:32.250
an hour.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:35.875
But yeah, kind of one of the goals that

00:25:35.875 --> 00:25:38.560
they service to kind of expose

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.900
potential gaps that you might have in

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.349
terms of understanding, so you might

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:42.593
need to go back and kind of re study

00:25:42.593 --> 00:25:43.893
and that might take a little longer,

00:25:43.893 --> 00:25:46.000
but that would be a good thing, but

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:46.670
they're not.

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:49.832
They're not super technical or kind of

00:25:49.832 --> 00:25:51.460
kind of complicated questions that you

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.780
have to do lots of calculations for

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.080
something, so they should be reasonably

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:56.550
straightforward.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.750
Do the quest points get added up to the

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:00.205
final grade?

00:26:00.205 --> 00:26:01.980
So yeah, so that.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.863
Quizzes are part of the grade, but they

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:06.880
are a small part and you also have

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.739
multiple attempts for each quiz, so you

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.090
can actually try once.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:12.350
See what you got wrong.

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:14.970
Try again so the intention is that you

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.400
essentially should be able to get full

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.110
credit for these online quizzes as long

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.060
as you stay on top of the deadlines.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.420
Although there's also high incentive to

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.890
not really just wait until the final

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:26.800
try for the quiz and try everything,

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.383
but they actually think through the

00:26:28.383 --> 00:26:30.024
questions because the types of

00:26:30.024 --> 00:26:31.105
questions you see on the quizzes are

00:26:31.105 --> 00:26:32.170
the same as what you'll see in the

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:32.760
examines.

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.469
So the exam will also be kind of

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.120
multiple choice or kind of number entry

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.740
type questions and so these are these

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.220
quizzes are the primary source of

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.030
practice that you get.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:43.600
For example, it's an exam list will be

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.000
worth more of your great.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:47.820
That said, kind of the homework is

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.436
still worth a lot and kind of none of

00:26:49.436 --> 00:26:51.383
the final or none of the examples will

00:26:51.383 --> 00:26:55.280
kind of by themselves, kind of force

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.570
you to fail the course if you don't do

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:58.250
that well, so I hope that this kind of

00:26:58.250 --> 00:26:59.840
great balance is reasonable.

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:02.790
So both quizzes and homeworks will be

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:03.920
posted and unrelated.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.220
Yes, correct.

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:07.490
So will post everything on this relate

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:08.465
web page.

00:27:08.465 --> 00:27:10.750
So if you just stay on top of that you

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:12.450
should be able to find all assignments.

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.100
So for quizzes.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.980
We won't post these 24 hours before the

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.180
deadline, which is not.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.510
I understand that's not a lot of hours.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.290
I will try to post them, give you even

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:28.890
more time in particular.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.597
So if like will try to post on Monday

00:27:31.597 --> 00:27:33.520
afternoon the quiz due on Wednesday or

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.000
by Monday afternoon there.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.230
But sometimes we do need a little bit

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:37.985
of extra time.

00:27:37.985 --> 00:27:40.560
A big reason is that the quiz is meant

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.070
to reflect the material we covered in

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:43.960
lecture, and I often don't know just

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.225
how far we will get a lecture.

00:27:45.225 --> 00:27:46.945
So then it requires some adjustment of

00:27:46.945 --> 00:27:48.730
the quiz right after it's released.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.590
And then there's always a short fuse

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:52.700
deadline between on Monday assigned

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.519
quiz due Wednesday.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.310
On the other hand, when we assign a

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:58.520
quiz due Monday, you should have more

00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:58.950
time.

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:02.040
So hopefully that's OK.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.590
If for any reason you're not able to

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.330
complete the quiz in a lot of time, let

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.110
us know and we'll give you an

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.480
extension.

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:10.970
So in total, for example, yes, three

00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:13.903
example it's and one final exam.

00:28:13.903 --> 00:28:16.670
And will exams be close book?

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:17.740
Or can we take notes?

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:21.400
The exams will be closed book and they

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.380
will be done through CBT off which

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:24.785
offers.

00:28:24.785 --> 00:28:26.920
So this is kind of a proctoring service

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.320
offered by the College of Engineering.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.380
I think it's seems to be the better

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:33.550
option and pretty much anything else

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:37.140
available, but there is so the plan

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.270
right now is to have the exam.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:40.520
Let's be an hour.

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:43.100
15 minutes long and to start at 9:00 AM

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.420
to 10:50.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:48.540
So that starts half an hour earlier

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.153
than the course.

00:28:49.153 --> 00:28:51.390
So like this is during course time but

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:52.839
30 minutes earlier.

00:28:52.839 --> 00:28:55.340
If you actually have a different course

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.716
or some other, there's another reason

00:28:57.716 --> 00:28:59.480
that you can't make this time on a

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.730
regular basis.

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:01.380
Let me know.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.805
I'm actually curious if this will cause

00:29:02.805 --> 00:29:05.270
a lot of problems, because if so, I

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.720
think we I can talk to CTF and possibly

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.490
we can change this to be just purely

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:11.510
within course time.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.850
But then the exam will probably be

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:15.986
shorter, so not an hour and 15 minutes,

00:29:15.986 --> 00:29:17.545
but somebody 5 minutes or something or

00:29:17.545 --> 00:29:17.780
not.

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:18.502
Wanna half.

00:29:18.502 --> 00:29:20.980
But this is kind of the default that

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.227
CBT have gave us when asking, and I

00:29:23.227 --> 00:29:25.710
think this will probably make most

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.270
people happy because it's just longer.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:30.040
But if it turns out that there's some

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.947
other queries 8:00 to 9:30 and a lot of

00:29:31.947 --> 00:29:34.590
people have a conflict with this, let

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.200
me know and maybe will actually make a

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:36.570
change.

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.459
But right now I think this is probably.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.750
A good idea, because there's also

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:42.925
conflict exam times.

00:29:42.925 --> 00:29:45.100
So CTF will kind of automatically

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.400
schedule conflict exams on 8:00 AM and

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.580
8:00 PM that day.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:50.690
So if you need to reschedule to one of

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:53.060
those, that should be relatively easy.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:54.990
However, for any kind of rescheduling

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.920
or conflict, I believe we need to

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.200
prove, I think for some of them, maybe

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.015
they'll be automatically approved, but

00:30:01.015 --> 00:30:03.060
generally don't assume that you can

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.830
kind of do this late and we try to stay

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:08.260
ahead of time and let CBT up now, and

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.435
I'll kind of generally approve complex

00:30:10.435 --> 00:30:11.860
as long as there are reasonable.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.620
I think these are also not the only

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.570
conflict, so if you just can't make the

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:17.110
example that day, you can take it on a

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.950
different day.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:19.160
It's also a little bit annoying that

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.150
the conflict is at 8:00 AM versus 9:00

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:22.830
AM, but this is the these times are

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:23.440
kind of fixed.

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:25.590
Let's see if there's more questions.

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:27.904
Facilities in person.

00:30:27.904 --> 00:30:29.482
You do not have to go anywhere in

00:30:29.482 --> 00:30:33.010
person, so the CTF will is a proctoring

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:33.191
service.

00:30:33.191 --> 00:30:34.920
So what they'll do is actually proctoru

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.004
over zoom and what you'll need to do is

00:30:37.004 --> 00:30:38.920
to set up a cell phone or something

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.700
else to point at your you and your

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:43.960
computer screen and there will be a

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:47.050
Proctor who is there who is not related

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:48.290
to the poor, so they can't really

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:49.830
answer questions, although if you run

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:51.190
into a technical issue you should

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:54.380
record it with them and they'll kind of

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.670
watch you to make sure that.

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.640
Only viewing the kind of the web page

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.540
are allowed to view, which is

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.740
essentially they relate.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:08.660
Age and they are familiar with how what

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.120
kind of relate infrastructure to the

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.140
best of my knowledge at least they have

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:12.780
been in the past.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.690
So let's see the answer, the actual

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:17.080
question.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:19.020
Online.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:22.300
Yeah, I guess there it's close book.

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.390
In the past we've also had just closed

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:26.260
book exams in kind of physical CBT

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.530
facilities, so this is not all that

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:30.630
different and the exam will just be

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:33.090
through there relate system.

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.620
We can also offer in Proctor exams

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.880
outside of CTF if it ever becomes

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:38.620
necessary.

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.290
So there's lots of these work arounds,

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.650
but hopefully the standard CTF thing

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:44.270
will actually serve us quite well.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:48.540
Yeah.

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:53.790
Did I miss any other question with me?

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:58.250
Is there any final project or anything

00:31:58.250 --> 00:31:58.676
like that?

00:31:58.676 --> 00:32:00.320
There is not a final project.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:04.600
Your one thing, so there actually used

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.050
to be a final project for the four

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:07.030
credit hours section.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.350
What I've done in kind of in planning

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:12.710
to do this here again is to just have

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:14.080
extra homework assignments for the four

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:14.950
credit hours section.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.025
There is a caveat to this in that I

00:32:19.025 --> 00:32:20.530
think the four credit hours section has

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:22.160
been restricted to graduate only, while

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.510
the three quarter section has been

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:24.945
restricted to undergraduate only.

00:32:24.945 --> 00:32:26.710
I notice that just this morning by

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:27.970
looking at essentially who's registered

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:28.740
for both.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.840
This is not actually my intention or

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.220
desire because I think.

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:35.500
The actual difference between three and

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.146
four credit hours sections is kind of

00:32:37.146 --> 00:32:39.180
some extra more technical material, and

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.700
so the extra credit hours for students

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.070
who want to dive a little bit deeper

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:43.339
into the course.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.290
We, who are not necessarily graduate

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:45.475
students.

00:32:45.475 --> 00:32:48.520
I think I do know that there are some

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.060
programs that require the full credit.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.200
Our version of the course.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.950
And do the graduate programs, but I'll

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:57.050
actually make a request that the

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:58.700
restrictions on the sections be lifted.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.664
So if you're an undergraduate and you

00:33:00.664 --> 00:33:02.270
want to take the forfeited, our version

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:03.840
of the course and complete these extra

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.121
assignments, that's great.

00:33:05.121 --> 00:33:06.676
And if you're a graduate student but

00:33:06.676 --> 00:33:07.800
you want to take the three credit hour

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.650
version of the course and have kind of.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.570
A lighter version of kind of assignment

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:14.460
load that's also totally fine with me,

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.740
it's just that are I think the system

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.800
was locked into this other mode.

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.410
Last two times we also had to ask to

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:22.940
make the change, but it seems it

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.240
doesn't carry over to you semesters.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.840


00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.950
Yep, so yeah, I guess I've already

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:30.630
mentioned this for credit everything,

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:33.060
so for that section will have some

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.300
additional homework questions.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:35.650


00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.430
I think I'm not yet sure exactly when

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.390
these will come over in what form.

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:45.340
In the past we had.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:48.070
In a sense, one homework that was kind

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:49.370
of an addendum homework for the full

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:50.520
credit hours section for every

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.830
throughout our homework and homework

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:53.120
would have like one question or so.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:53.950
I think.

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:55.260
Maybe I want to do a little bit less

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.740
this semester again because it's just

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.120
there's a pandemic going on.

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:02.540
But we'll see exactly how, but there

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:03.960
will be some homework questions coming

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:04.610
that are extra.

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:08.370
Since the 4th grade with those kind of

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:10.573
mean that we get 33% more kind of

00:34:10.573 --> 00:34:11.792
credit for the course than the three

00:34:11.792 --> 00:34:13.780
credit hours does, formally speaking.

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.470
Other questions that I'm making list.

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:23.020
Do we have homework for every week so

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.520
Homeworks will be assigned?

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:26.700
BI weekly.

00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:30.530
I think my plan was to assign homework

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.735
this week, do 2 weeks from now and to

00:34:32.735 --> 00:34:34.350
kind of keep assigning homework

00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:35.580
whenever one is do.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.420
Unless there is an exam the following

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.607
week and then skip a week to give you

00:34:39.607 --> 00:34:42.457
kind of a weekend or so to study for

00:34:42.457 --> 00:34:43.052
the exam.

00:34:43.052 --> 00:34:44.560
The current plan is to have home runs

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.840
do as they were before and Friday

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.060
evenings so you will be assigned

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:50.660
homework on Friday evening and it would

00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.819
be do kind of two weeks from that time.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:55.460
Assuming we actually get it out on

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:56.720
time, which hopefully will stay on top

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.140
of that.

00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:58.640


00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.690
Yeah, so that's kind of the plan.

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:02.774
This is this is a in the intention is

00:35:02.774 --> 00:35:04.000
that this is a somewhat lighter load of

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.230
Homer extent in previous semesters.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.470
However, the quizzes are stating just

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.050
as regular, so hopefully this gives

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:11.480
everybody a chance to stay on top of

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.060
the course.

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:12.250
I think.

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:14.250
Kind of if there's too few things going

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:15.590
on that lines were too loose.

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:19.260
It's kind of easy to postpone kind of

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:19.530
studying.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:20.860
And of course like this, and that's not

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:22.270
really great.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.130
So hopefully this is a good structure.

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:28.820
Us, somebody asked if there's any

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.530
difference between essentially

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:31.183
different sections.

00:35:31.183 --> 00:35:33.140
No, there's absolutely no difference.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.976
So except for the three versus 4 credit

00:35:34.976 --> 00:35:37.040
hour version, and I think for no matter

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.110
whether you were kind of register mass

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:41.055
yes or ECE, there should be three and

00:35:41.055 --> 00:35:42.230
four credit hour versions.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:45.120
I think each one of those has been

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.780
assigned like some number of fixed

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:48.690
slots, so if it looks like this section

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:50.910
is full, just send me an email and

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:52.670
we'll figure it out like they were

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:53.620
nowhere near capacity.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.870
I think there's something like 150 wild

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:56.840
capacities 200.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.320
It's a zoom call anyway, so in a sense

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.129
we should be able to get you into the

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:02.460
course into the right section.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.105
If you're already, then we can also do

00:36:04.105 --> 00:36:06.370
that later and in the Meanwhile you can

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:08.410
start and work through everything.

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:09.540
One thing you should do is to actually

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.509
create an account on relate and that

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:13.450
will allow you to access everything

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:15.999
here to create an account and relate

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:16.360
well.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.287
You really don't even need account, you

00:36:17.287 --> 00:36:18.690
can just log in through your.

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:23.170
Not ID and password, so hasn't

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:24.810
implication system that goes through

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:25.660
University of Illinois.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.040
And once you registered for the course

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.530
in this way, then you can actually

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:30.930
complete all the assignments and submit

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:32.840
them, and we're going to kind of just

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.320
great Norman stuff without actually

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.236
checking who is who is actually

00:36:36.236 --> 00:36:37.200
registered at that time.

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:41.650
So the time you registration actually

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:44.295
important is maybe once the exams come.

00:36:44.295 --> 00:36:46.940
So which is like in late February?

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.260
Because I think TF.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:51.640
Maybe will require that students be

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:53.810
officially registered, but by that time

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:55.800
hopefully all these issues with

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.870
sections are sorted out.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:00.780
Let's see any further questions.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:03.660
Are there quizzes?

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.185
Hi Miss period the previous stuff are

00:37:07.185 --> 00:37:09.195
there unlimited attempts for quizzes

00:37:09.195 --> 00:37:10.465
there is not.

00:37:10.465 --> 00:37:12.230
I forget exactly, so I think we have

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:14.090
three atoms.

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:15.950
Pretty sure.

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:17.680
Let's see what their policy say.

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:21.925
3 go to the top step of these, one with

00:37:21.925 --> 00:37:23.490
the higher grade will count.

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:25.520
So for multiple choice questions this

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.820
is almost unlimited attempts because

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:28.140
you can tell what you got wrong when

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:30.830
you first attempt and so forth, so

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:32.390
hopefully that's good.

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:34.430
Let's see other questions.

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:44.620
I think I got everything.

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:46.210
Let me know if I missed something.

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:48.350
Right and then the other thing I want

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:49.250
to show you is.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:53.170
Let's wait on that first, second.

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:55.670
Anything else about the web page they

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:56.960
need to say so will post.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.322
All lectures will be recorded.

00:37:58.322 --> 00:38:00.380
So also this is being recorded and

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.030
things will be posted on media space.

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.550
So kind of I would encourage you to

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.040
maybe.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.540
Yeah, so like things will be available

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.420
asynchronously if you need them.

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:12.780
There will sometimes be in class

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.160
activities which you can complete

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.993
through relate and usually will be like

00:38:15.993 --> 00:38:18.580
kind of coding questions.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.800
Those will generally not be for credit,

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.290
but I will also post them probably in

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:23.730
outline.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:24.830
So if you want to kind of take a look

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:26.750
at the questions offline if you're not

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:28.449
physically attending, not attending

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:29.610
lectures synchronously.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.930
We those will be available to.

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:35.750
I think that's.

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:40.430
Most administrative things that I

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:41.270
wanted to mention.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.980
Any questions on that type of thing?

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:48.970
OK.

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:51.530
So then let me stop sharing.

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.530
So let's so I want to show you one

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:55.650
thing here and then I'm going to switch

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:58.420
to shame screen on my notebook where.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.430
I'm ranked so the way I would actually

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:05.740
prefer that questions be asked, because

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:06.990
Zoom chat has.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.830
Various issues, and in particular when

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:11.900
I'm sharing screen writing on

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.635
something, it's generally I'm not able

00:39:13.635 --> 00:39:14.350
to see the questions.

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:17.820
I don't really get notifications, so to

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.360
make sure I actually the question right

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:19.660
away.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.730
If you have a technical question about

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.860
what I'm doing, especially use this

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.400
send instant message feature.

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:27.200
And if you click here.

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:31.210
If it works, let's see.

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:35.960
I just slow, so if you type a message

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.120
here it will actually appear on

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:40.889
directly on my screen on my on my

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:41.490
notebook.

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:44.820
So I'm going to 2nd type test and click

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:45.170
send.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:46.590
But before that let me stop sharing

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:49.917
this screen and start sharing my screen

00:39:49.917 --> 00:39:50.430
here.

00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:57.380
So now I'm going to send a message

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:59.160
saying, hi Edgar.

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:03.060
And after some lag.

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:06.910
Selected twice a message appears right

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:07.200
here.

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:11.590
And so this way you can ask questions

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:13.650
in a way that's anonymous to everybody

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:14.130
else.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:15.750
Although there is some log.

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:18.560
If I if something needs to be checked.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:21.900
And it will write away appear here.

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:23.476
So I will see your question right away

00:40:23.476 --> 00:40:25.120
so that instant message feature through

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.070
late is.

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:28.680
I think a good way to ask questions.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.970
We actually also used in life course

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:33.590
rooms like in physical lectures and it

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:34.410
was working well.

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:38.920
It is also feel free to use this chat,

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.260
although that I may not see it right

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:42.550
away or to just kind of.

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:44.850
Interrupt me, perhaps an ask the

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:45.310
question.

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:46.510
Hopefully that will.

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:49.710
Work, but I understand that we assume

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:50.890
this is kind of tricky.

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:52.760
I will also, as a result, generally

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.783
probably be asking all of you last

00:40:54.783 --> 00:40:56.210
questions as throughout the courses I

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:57.990
wouldn't normally in a physical lecture

00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:59.580
because it just is the case.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.650
It is more difficult and to kind of

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:03.186
answer questions back and forth and in

00:41:03.186 --> 00:41:03.780
a quick web.

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:07.330
I see more questions.

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:10.750
I do not see the demos from the website

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:12.620
will be posted up through the lectures.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.330
I think the downloads are should

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:15.309
already be posted.

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:17.260


00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.190
So maybe also maybe refresh the page.

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:22.920
I just updated it this morning, added

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.240
demos, including some other changes.

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:27.420
If you still cannot access the demo, so

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.000
let me know.

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:30.780
The office hours are actually not just

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:33.160
yet posted that will be posted this

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.660
afternoon, so we only have our first

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.315
team meeting at 1:00 PM today.

00:41:38.315 --> 00:41:39.890
So that's when I will be quitting the

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:40.180
GS.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.170
But one they can.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.330
Have office hours so kind of keep an

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:48.160
eye on and that will be posted this

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:48.580
afternoon.

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:50.910
Yeah, good questions.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.720
OK, any other questions?

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.920
OK, so then, let's actually begin

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.350
talking a little bit about course

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:09.650
content, and perhaps first motivating

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:12.140
the course a little bit, as well as

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:13.800
saying a little bit with medical

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:14.200
assistance.

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:15.360
OK.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.180
So that kind of.

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:26.470
Scientific numerical analysis.

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:28.065
It can kind of be viewed as a part of

00:42:28.065 --> 00:42:29.150
scientific computing, but really these

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:31.050
are all just kind of broad words.

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:33.639
American analysis and kind of

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.530
scientific computing generally concerns

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:38.650
the study of kind of ways to compute.

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.770
Solutions to numerical problems arising

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:43.030
from the physical world.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.960
Sometimes associated with kind of

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.450
problems arising from differential

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:48.690
equations, because differential

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.800
equations are used to model many of the

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.200
phenomenon in the physical work.

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:56.080
Physical world, however, I think many

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.830
of us understand that the numerical

00:42:57.830 --> 00:42:59.580
techniques that will study in this

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.040
course are also much more broadly

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.100
applicable than just kind of PZ that

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.810
can be used in a whole variety of

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:08.710
conflicts, including just kind of data

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:12.085
analysis questions, but also for kind

00:43:12.085 --> 00:43:13.260
of scientific problems that are not

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.400
necessarily being modeled by

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.350
differential equations.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:19.590
But some kind of examples of classical

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:21.060
kind of scientific computing problems.

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:24.730
Are kind of dynamics of particles in

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:27.890
time and how they interact models for

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:29.050
kind of fluid and air flow and

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:32.680
engineering as well as kind of PDE

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.950
constrained America optimization.

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:35.060
So finding kind of optimal

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:38.140
configurations of some particular

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.670
object that perhaps wants to design A

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:41.860
relative to summon environment.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.560
Kind of a different area, one that I've

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.090
been interested in.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:47.340
This kind of quantum chemistry, which

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:49.710
is the study of many electron systems

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:51.700
where the shorter equation describes

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:53.530
their interaction and the goal is to

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:54.970
kind of understanding the probability

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:56.240
distribution of the particles.

00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:00.503
So however kind of the core concepts of

00:44:00.503 --> 00:44:02.687
the course are really linear algebra

00:44:02.687 --> 00:44:06.500
and kind of its applications and

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.360
optimization and really kind of the

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:09.950
last.

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:14.640
5th or so, at least in the way that it

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.460
usually ends up being when I teach, it

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:19.150
is kind of ODEs and PDEs and application

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:20.070
of the metrics there.

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:24.530
So these kind of basic linear algebra

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:27.325
kernels actually underlie almost much

00:44:27.325 --> 00:44:28.900
of everything that is done.

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:31.080
That is kind of large scale computing,

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:34.270
so it turns out that kind of we can use

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:36.940
matrices to model problems arising from

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:37.500
anything.

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.890
Kind of linear systems and linear least

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:42.300
squares in the medical optimization are

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:42.780
ubiquitous.

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:43.960
They show up in kind of machine

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.100
learning methods and data analysis, but

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.540
also in just about any other area of

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:50.620
computing that has a large data and

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:51.920
then wants to transform it.

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.516
And that actually needs to do kind of

00:44:55.516 --> 00:44:57.420
large liver, large scale computing.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:58.950
I think this is also reflected by the

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:00.350
fact that if you look at, for example,

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:02.540
the field of computer architecture or

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:04.859
compilers, and you look at the types of

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.610
benchmarks they consider, a lot of them

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:08.903
are essentially linear algebra or kind

00:45:08.903 --> 00:45:10.700
of derived from American methods,

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:11.750
because these have been kind of the

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:14.370
driving force behind computing since

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:16.850
its inception and before so kind of

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:18.980
applied mathematics and kind of

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.600
computing has always been done to

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.280
fundamentally for these types of

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:23.000
problems.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:23.570
It's kind of.

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:24.975
Relatively recent thing that it's about

00:45:24.975 --> 00:45:27.460
to do all of these other things that

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.660
are useful to people as a result of,

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.050
like the prevalence of computers.

00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:32.280
OK.

00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:36.690


00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:41.160
So kind of a short kind of motivating

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:45.190
example is kind of newtons laws of

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:47.680
mechanics and how they can be described

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.150
using some number of degrees of

00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:49.480
freedom.

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:51.940
So.

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:56.040
An example of this is that for an up

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.979
and down piston or we might require

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:00.620
only one degree of freedom, so one

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:03.200
variable to represent it at one

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.771
particle system in 3D space requires 3

00:46:05.771 --> 00:46:08.295
degrees of freedom at two particles,

00:46:08.295 --> 00:46:10.819
system requires 6 degrees of freedom

00:46:10.819 --> 00:46:13.612
for the two locations and two particles

00:46:13.612 --> 00:46:15.757
at a fixed distance might require 5

00:46:15.757 --> 00:46:17.420
degrees of freedom, so these are

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:18.670
essentially ways that were

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:20.700
parameterising particular physical

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.730
system with some number of variables

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:24.470
that then allow us to model how it

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:25.220
evolves.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:29.410
Or what configuration or of it would

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:31.320
satisfy certain physical equations

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.580
which might provide constraints on

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:34.400
these degrees of freedom?

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:37.230
So more generally, kind of if you have

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:38.560
an end particle system, this will be

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.450
great described by 300 degrees of

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:40.850
freedom.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:44.070
And so kind of.

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:47.080
One can in this domain thinking for

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.900
example about trajectory's.

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:52.300
In the configuration space.

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:55.850
So in this R3, N and these.

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:59.750
Will describe the free energy

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:00.590
configuration.

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.190
Which is.

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.530
What we might be looking for in the

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:12.419
kind of mechanical problem mechanical

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:13.170
engineering problem?

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:16.730
So there's also a variety of choices of

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:18.310
their representation that go beyond

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:20.109
just the number of degrees of freedom.

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:22.386
For example, the same number of degrees

00:47:22.386 --> 00:47:23.860
of freedom might be expressed in terms

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:27.620
of parameters or coefficients of basis

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:30.720
functions, which are kind of

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:33.540
representing some physical space, and

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:35.256
the distribution of particles in that

00:47:35.256 --> 00:47:35.479
space.

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:37.380
I see there is a question.

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:40.800
I like I click that.

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:44.620
Right, so here when you just five

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:46.590
degrees of freedom, since we've fixed

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:47.240
the distance.

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:48.920
So in a sense, we know that.

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:53.650
Kind of.

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:57.840
These are at some fixed distance D and

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:00.210
so once we've fixed the location here,

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:02.700
there's only two degrees of freedom

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:05.610
that are necessary to specify the

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:09.030
location of the Third Point, which kind

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:11.110
of seasonally in a rotational basis.

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:12.290
So we have some angles that when you

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:12.610
could pick.

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:15.350
So this is one way that it kind of the

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:16.990
presence of a constraint then reduces

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:17.590
our system.

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:21.490
Terms of the number degrees of freedom.

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:24.470
OK, and that also is kind of useful

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:26.460
terminology that's often used to

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.140
describe physical problems so.

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:31.480
A problem might be said to be very

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.000
complicated if the number of degrees of

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.490
freedoms in the millions or billions,

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:36.190
which kind of is a different way of

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:37.310
saying that you're studying a system

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:38.640
with many particles, many different

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.783
components, and it's something that

00:48:40.783 --> 00:48:42.430
might require large scale computation.

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:46.740
Three translational to rotational.

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:48.050
Yeah, that's a good way.

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.020
You're not seeing those interesting.

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:56.520
Hold on.

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.740
It seems that I need to share in a

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:01.290
different way.

00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:17.900
My laptop says sharing but my other

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:19.510
laptop doesn't see me sharing, so it's

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:20.080
not working.

00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:27.610
Australian.

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:29.610
OK, there we go.

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:32.466
So yeah I did all this so that this

00:49:32.466 --> 00:49:34.020
question shows up now on my on the

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:34.580
bottom right.

00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:37.020
So this is probably were also very

00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:38.500
confused when I was talking about the

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.379
high Edgar example because this was

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:41.930
actually showing up right here.

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:44.960
So if you do that kind of sent instant

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.380
message thing through late through.

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.390
Participant question shows up like

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.650
this.

00:49:49.330 --> 00:49:50.170
So yes, indeed.

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:50.900
It's kind of 3.

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:52.280
Three translational to rotational

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:53.770
degrees of freedom that we would have

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:55.140
for this fourth point.

00:49:57.860 --> 00:49:58.410
OK.

00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:04.230
So to say a little bit about the

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:05.050
course.

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:08.090
So.

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.415
Kind of the steps that will take to

00:50:12.415 --> 00:50:15.110
take to start from kind of a problem in

00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:16.460
the continuous physical space and

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:17.510
reduce it to.

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:20.520
Kind of a concrete problem that we can

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:21.300
solve.

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:24.110
Look as follows.

00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:25.950
So one thing that will be doing is

00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:26.770
discretization.

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:31.580
Which is kind of.

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:35.100
The mapping of some continuous function

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:35.670
to some.

00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:37.350
Discrete domain.

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:40.590
So for example, by imposing a grid.

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:45.310
And then computing values that and this

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:48.080
is discretization is a theme that kind

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.470
of arises throughout the course will

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:50.973
often want to think about continuous

00:50:50.973 --> 00:50:53.620
models as well as different ways to

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:55.874
arrive at them from a collection of

00:50:55.874 --> 00:50:56.120
points.

00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:59.317
So interpolation innocence as well as

00:50:59.317 --> 00:51:00.895
to fit continuous models to points as

00:51:00.895 --> 00:51:03.410
well as to actually use discrete

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:05.205
collection of numbers to model a

00:51:05.205 --> 00:51:05.740
continuous system.

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:10.500
So one other way kind of theme or the

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.110
course that will have that allows us to

00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:14.570
study complicated systems is that will

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:18.710
map nonlinear continuous things too.

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:24.120
Linear, so it turns out that kind of a

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:25.190
sufficiently high dimensional in your

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:26.490
system with suffices to describe

00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:28.300
essentially nonlinear phenomena.

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:32.720
Another theme that will arise is that

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.420
kind of complicated functions.

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:41.630
Will be mapped to polynomials.

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:44.820
And will work quite a bit with

00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.370
polynomials throughout the course.

00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:50.990
And similarly differential equations

00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:52.640
will be mapped to.

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:55.050
Linear equations.

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:58.220
So do you see kind of many of the

00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:00.130
subset will take to work with these

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:01.260
complex problems.

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:02.800
Modeling the physical world will

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.780
involve essentially linearizing them,

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:07.040
kind of making them discrete units and

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.415
stuffing stuff into matrices.

00:52:08.415 --> 00:52:10.390
And finally, what will end up with our

00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:12.400
kind of matrix problems that will then

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:13.670
need to solve accurately.

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:15.340
And it turned, and that in the self is

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:17.530
a massive field and a huge challenge.

00:52:17.530 --> 00:52:19.530
So much of the queries concerns this

00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:21.690
kind of core linear algebra aspect of

00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:22.980
how do you actually solve linear

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:26.010
systems, least squares problems and.

00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:28.400
Other things involving kind of basic

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.450
matrices as well as how to use those

00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:32.510
tools to actually solve more

00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:33.490
complicated problems.

00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:36.660
So we're all kind of structure will be

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:37.570
as follows.

00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:41.203
Will start with kind of the study of

00:52:41.203 --> 00:52:44.165
error in floating point, so both kind

00:52:44.165 --> 00:52:45.990
of in the scalar and vector sense and

00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:47.315
will try to understand a little bit

00:52:47.315 --> 00:52:49.266
what it means to have a different.

00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:51.086
What are different types of sources of

00:52:51.086 --> 00:52:52.670
error in medical simulation and

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:53.755
numerical computation?

00:52:53.755 --> 00:52:56.413
How can we bound these and analyze them

00:52:56.413 --> 00:52:57.760
to actually make sure we're computing

00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:58.390
the right thing?

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:00.450
This is an innocence kind of the core

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:03.430
study of medical analysis is to agree

00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:07.109
the tradeoff between kind of

00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:08.130
computational efficiency of the

00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:11.270
algorithm and kind of it's stability.

00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:12.920
So it's the degree to which it's

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:13.360
accurate.

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:16.200
So having kind of laid this foundation.

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:25.040
Switch these will start talking about

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:27.660
different types of matrix computations.

00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:31.640
So this will involve.

00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:34.570
First of all, linear systems of

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:35.220
equations.

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.120
As well as least squares problems, and

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:40.400
then eigenvalue problems.

00:53:45.250 --> 00:53:46.965
So these are three of the major types

00:53:46.965 --> 00:53:50.090
of problems that arise in the Merkle

00:53:50.090 --> 00:53:51.236
linear algebra.

00:53:51.236 --> 00:53:53.600
So having established this kind of core

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.320
in America, linear algebra will

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.690
transition and I don't really have

00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:57.200
enough space.

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.500
Let's continue here into.

00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:03.120
What might be probably described as

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.220
numerical optimization?

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:07.700
So we'll talk about solving non linear

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:10.210
systems of equations as well as finding

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:12.980
minima of nonlinear equations which are

00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:14.000
two problems that are kind of

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.470
fundamentally related as we also will

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:16.210
see in methods.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.600
And the way that will actually go about

00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:21.320
solving these problems is by reducing

00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:23.300
them to matrix computations.

00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:25.420


00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:30.670
Then I kind of also through the use of

00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:31.910
techniques for.

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:38.000
Numerical integration and

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:38.920
differentiation.

00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:41.210
Will proceed to study.

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:42.500


00:54:43.690 --> 00:54:44.510
Who dies?

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:46.040
And.

00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:50.200
PDS which can be phrased in terms of

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.538
nonlinear optimization problems or in

00:54:52.538 --> 00:54:54.045
terms of kind of integration problems

00:54:54.045 --> 00:54:57.670
in some cases, and kind of via that

00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:59.410
route eventually reduced to matrix

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:01.560
computations as well as the other types

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:02.480
of discretizations.

00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:04.420
So as you see, kind of course has a

00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:07.170
structure where we start and Mr Chapter

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:09.489
one, and it's fairly quick, is kind of

00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:11.805
basic questions of error representation

00:55:11.805 --> 00:55:14.130
of floating point numbers and things

00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:14.760
like that.

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:16.750
Then we'll go in and talk about

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:18.120
numerical linear algebra and this will

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:19.930
be in a sense, I think a core part of

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:21.470
the course and also a part that you

00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:24.400
really want to internalize, because as

00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.030
we will transition into later parts

00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:28.010
will make use of what we've learned in

00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:30.000
this kind of medical knowledge

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:30.430
perception.

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:33.150
And from that will kind of studying

00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:35.160
America optimization, which is useful

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.220
both for kind of later problems, will

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:39.190
do with differential equations, but

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:42.160
also outside of the domain of

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:43.570
differential equations altogether.

00:55:43.570 --> 00:55:45.110
So really problem with machine

00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:45.640
learning.

00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.270
Mike, for example, also look like

00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:50.900
nonlinear optimization problems and the

00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:52.800
methods that will study here are very

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:53.330
much relevant.

00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:54.820


00:55:56.970 --> 00:55:59.770
OK, so that's I think much of what I

00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:01.560
wanted to say about kind of the general

00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:03.250
structure of the course, so hopefully

00:56:03.250 --> 00:56:04.900
this provides some motivation of kind

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:07.160
of why I will start with kind of low

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:08.610
level technical topics and how it will

00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:10.740
progress throughout the semester.

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:13.095
One challenge this semester is that I

00:56:13.095 --> 00:56:16.650
think will have 25 total lectures, so

00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:18.869
there are three of the lectures.

00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:22.890
Or is it gonna be 24?

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:24.320
So I think three of the lectures should

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:27.560
be exams and I think two of the

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:29.760
lectures are cancelled.

00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:33.010
Because of the fact that we don't have

00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:33.930
spring break this semester.

00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:36.190
But overall, this means that we

00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:38.160
actually have fewer lectures than usual

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:40.490
and in previous musters the lectures

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:41.920
weren't necessarily enough to get

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.100
through all of the course content

00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:43.780
anyway.

00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:47.790
So we'll see how this works out.

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.780
I'll kind of try my best to make it at

00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:53.280
least through the end of the PDEs.

00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:56.690
But somewhere along the way, I'll have

00:56:56.690 --> 00:57:00.819
to be a little bit of brief or go into

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:02.760
less detail will see exactly how that

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:03.800
works out.

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:05.830
I also have to balance that with,

00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:07.540
of course, not going too fast, which is

00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:08.280
often the challenge.

00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:14.200
But yeah, one thing is that we might

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.870
not actually like every single chapter

00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:17.960
in particular like the last chapter.

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:22.520
I think one chapter they almost never

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:23.620
get through is like random number

00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:25.460
generators, but also things like the

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:28.316
FFT at the very end of the course.

00:57:28.316 --> 00:57:31.190
We often don't really get to.

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:32.236
I think last time I thought this course

00:57:32.236 --> 00:57:33.530
we did not get to that part.

00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:35.170
Although maybe I said just a few words

00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:36.220
about in the last lecture.

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:39.480
So this semester maybe we even don't

00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:41.480
quite get that far, but I think that's

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:42.700
kind of the upper bound to a really

00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:42.840
good.

00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:46.160


00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:47.710
OK.

00:57:51.790 --> 00:57:54.220
So let's then kind of start talking a

00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:56.030
little bit about the formalism of

00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:58.160
problems so.

00:57:58.790 --> 00:57:59.820
Our goal.

00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:04.520
Kind of generally might be to be.

00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:06.920
Given some input which say is represented

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:10.890
by a vector to compute and output given

00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:13.260
by the function f applied to x.

00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:14.840
So.

00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:19.062
Kind of their one question we might ask

00:58:19.062 --> 00:58:20.580
is one of those that were problem

00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:24.040
actually a reasonable one, and in the

00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:25.670
numerical analysis this is known as the

00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:27.530
notion of ill posededness or well

00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:31.273
posedness so we'll say the problem is

00:58:31.273 --> 00:58:32.139
well posed.

00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:33.850
If.

00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:37.770
The solution.

00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:40.560
Exists and is unique.

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:47.150
As well as.

00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:49.260


00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:54.940
It is continuous.

00:58:57.810 --> 00:58:58.630
With respect.

00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:02.150
To the input.

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:04.990


00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:07.100
An otherwise

00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:08.780
I will say.

00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:11.330
The problem is ill post.

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:16.060
So in if we think of kind of our

00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:18.410
problem as a function mapping inputs to

00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:21.230
outputs, if it's a function that already

00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:23.770
means a bunch of nice things, nice

00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:24.105
things.

00:59:24.105 --> 00:59:25.440
So assuming that we can evaluate the

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:27.320
function, the solution exists and is

00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:27.700
unique.

00:59:29.350 --> 00:59:31.760
But we might not really know whether

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:35.480
still it's well posed, but we need the

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:37.771
other thing we need for it to be well

00:59:37.771 --> 00:59:40.710
posed is for it to be continuous and.

00:59:42.550 --> 00:59:43.790
This is enforced,

00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:48.080
for example, by making sure that the

00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.160
derivative of x

00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:52.600
It is never Infinity, so it's never a

00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:53.200
nascent.

00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:55.420
So as long as our function doesn't have

00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:57.150
such asymptotes, it will be continuous

00:59:57.150 --> 01:00:00.180
everywhere, and that's good enough.

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:03.780
And within here we.

01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:07.400
Somewhere implicitly we have in mind

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:10.660
that domain, so here we picked.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.260
x to come from R^n.

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.730
So R^n is kind of real vectors of

01:00:15.730 --> 01:00:19.133
dimension n, but we might restrict our

01:00:19.133 --> 01:00:22.074
domain and only consider some subset of

01:00:22.074 --> 01:00:25.670
kind of vectors x within R^n and then

01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:27.650
ask if all these of these conditions

01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:29.080
apply over that domain.

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:32.347
We might also ask you what is kind of

01:00:32.347 --> 01:00:34.320
is it is this problem well posed for a

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.960
particular X, so we just have a single

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.523
input in mind and the question is kind

01:00:38.523 --> 01:00:40.400
of still largely makes sense.

01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:43.270
So this kind of domain for which we're

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:45.920
considering a problem is important, and

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.740
this also makes sense from a computer

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:48.700
science perspective.

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:50.750
So in a sense you want to specify

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:53.130
ultimately an algorithm for computing F

01:00:53.130 --> 01:00:55.000
of X, and your algorithm should be able

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.210
to handle a variety of inputs X coming

01:00:58.210 --> 01:00:58.980
from some domain.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.490
And it should work for all X in the

01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:05.190
domain and you kind of want to if you

01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:06.449
are considering error, you want to

01:01:06.450 --> 01:01:08.610
analyze the worst case behavior of your

01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:10.470
algorithm over potential inputs.

01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:13.330
So it kind of some worst case input

01:01:13.330 --> 01:01:14.580
will force you to divide by zero.

01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:16.120
That's something you want to know.

01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:22.000
OK, so that is kind of a notion of well

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.410
posed or ill posed.

01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:25.240
Is there any questions or am I missing

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.200
any shot?

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:38.220
It seems there's questions, but I missed

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:38.470
them.

01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:42.605
Or it seems that there was just a cat on

01:01:42.605 --> 01:01:43.120
the keyboard.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.849
There was a question about the lectures

01:01:44.850 --> 01:01:47.901
being recorded, so the lectures will be

01:01:47.901 --> 01:01:49.810
recorded and the recordings will be

01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:51.070
placed on media space.

01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:54.300
Encourage you also use this instant

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:56.730
message thing for questions because

01:01:56.730 --> 01:01:58.040
like I don't really get notifications

01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.920
for this in chat, so the question is

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.525
actually to do with something urgent.

01:02:01.525 --> 01:02:03.960
I won't be able to answer it and I can

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.570
relate to the cat on the keyboard

01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:06.225
problem.

01:02:06.225 --> 01:02:08.310
You might see my cat not too long from

01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:08.500
now.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:11.150
OK.

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:14.950
So let's then talk about error.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:17.490
So.

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.730
For error there is.

01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:22.840
Kind of.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.960
So kind of the most basic thing we can

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.780
talk about is say, why is the true

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:32.970
solution to our problem of computing f

01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:33.910
for an input X.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:35.980
But instead.

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:42.040
computed y hat right

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.110
so some other.

01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:46.380
Some other result, perhaps?

01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:48.000
We computed it because we applied f

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.120
inaccurately, so we have instead applied

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:50.650
f hat.

01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:55.760
So then our absolute error.

01:02:56.730 --> 01:02:57.980
And as we'll soon know, this is the

01:02:57.980 --> 01:02:59.860
absolute forward error.

01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:05.180
Will be given what by the difference

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:05.900
between

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:07.530
y

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:09.340
and... y hat and y.

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:13.840
Often I get the question of does the

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.710
sign matter and also note that there is

01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:16.360
a sign right?

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.915
So what matters that there is that

01:03:18.915 --> 01:03:20.866
there is a sign what the sign is.

01:03:20.866 --> 01:03:22.010
I myself can't remember.

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:23.480
I just have to look up on the slide.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.490
So whether it's y minus, y hat or

01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:26.615
y hat minus

01:03:26.615 --> 01:03:28.080
y doesn't matter as long as you're

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.930
consistent about in your analysis.

01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:31.760
But the sign does matter and.

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:35.700
The magnitude of the error is

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.850
something, so sometimes you will see

01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:41.780
discussion of error and it has implied

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:43.455
in it that we're talking about

01:03:43.455 --> 01:03:43.860
magnitude.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.749
Other times will say explicitly that we

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:47.995
thought would want to consider the

01:03:47.995 --> 01:03:49.380
magnitude of the error, but within

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:51.784
analysis itself often we want to

01:03:51.784 --> 01:03:53.235
consider error not just in magnitude

01:03:53.235 --> 01:03:54.340
but also in sign.

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:55.980
One reason for this is that we might

01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:57.310
have multiple errors and they could

01:03:57.310 --> 01:03:58.570
cancel and.

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:00.860
Cancellation of errors can actually

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:02.060
kind of result in a better error

01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:02.460
analysis.

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:04.020
You see that in fact everything is OK.

01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:05.540


01:04:06.850 --> 01:04:07.230
OK.

01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:11.730
So that's our absolute error and I see

01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:12.300
your question.

01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:19.200


01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:20.690
They won't be in the.

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:22.155
I'm not sure what the campus page

01:04:22.155 --> 01:04:25.050
actually is, but yeah, I will be

01:04:25.050 --> 01:04:26.372
posting them on media space.

01:04:26.372 --> 01:04:28.485
I think I actually have to post them on

01:04:28.485 --> 01:04:30.970
media space for DRES accommodation

01:04:30.970 --> 01:04:31.460
purposes.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:34.500
I haven't worked with media space

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.680
before and what I actually did in, for

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.050
example the previous semesters post all

01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:41.010
lectures on my personal website.

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:43.216
If there's issues with media space, I

01:04:43.216 --> 01:04:45.462
will also do that and then just post

01:04:45.462 --> 01:04:48.000
the links as well as links to the

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.035
transcript directly on the course web

01:04:50.035 --> 01:04:50.720
page.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.250
But I for now will try to just use

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:55.940
media space and I'll update the relate

01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:57.350
web page with the media space link.

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:00.280
So hopefully that works, but I did hear

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.570
that there's been problems with media

01:05:01.570 --> 01:05:02.510
space in the past.

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:05.370
So we'll hopefully that won't be the

01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:05.830
case for us.

01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:08.560
Yep, OK.

01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:15.120
So that's the absolute error the.

01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:18.180
Relative error in this case, again,

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:20.170
referring to the forward error, will

01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:24.020
simply be Delta y / y.

01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:26.940
Or in particular with the magnitude of

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:27.260
y.

01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:28.960


01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:35.030
Yeah, I'm surprised they don't have a

01:05:35.030 --> 01:05:36.320
magnitude in my slide.

01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.850
Soon I will.

01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:46.310
All set up.

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:50.950
And that will be again posted,

01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:51.420
unrelated.

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:56.120
OK, so that's the kind of notions of

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:58.620
absolute error and relative error, and

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.080
these are fairly standard.

01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:03.740
So let's talk a little bit about where

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:05.530
error can actually come from.

01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:09.550
So one basic source of error is

01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:11.070
representation of numbers.

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:13.320


01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:17.310
And what will focus on in this course

01:07:17.310 --> 01:07:18.820
is notion of floating point

01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:19.520
representations.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:22.970
Like this which.

01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:28.700
So kind of a more basic example is that

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:29.050
we.

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:35.060
Cannot represent.

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:41.350
Pie on a computer, right to we simply

01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:43.780
can't store all the digits necessary to

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:46.220
represent an irrational number.

01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:49.380
So typically also.

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:52.510
Kind of in practice.

01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:57.410
We're limited to 32 or 64 bit

01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:59.250
representations of floating point.

01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:01.280
Actually, floating point is become also

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.330
a hot topic.

01:08:02.330 --> 01:08:04.140
Research wise more recently because.

01:08:06.090 --> 01:08:09.490
These days there's also 8 and 16 bit.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.800
Floating point representations

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.750
motivated by the desire to do low

01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:17.719
precision computation, which in the

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:20.250
field of machine learning is been shown

01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:22.720
to be kind of Bible, while

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.319
traditionally actually much you kind of

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:25.360
scientific computing in American

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.950
Alesis, you assume double precision and

01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:29.439
you do everything in double precision

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:31.729
or double precision means you use 64

01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:33.480
bit representations of numbers.

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:34.965
So you kind of use in a sense of

01:08:34.965 --> 01:08:35.940
precision you can get.

01:08:37.530 --> 01:08:40.190
Typically because kind of working with

01:08:40.190 --> 01:08:43.360
that's a problem that will talk about

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:45.560
you actually want a lot of accuracy and

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:46.900
you're trying to get a lot of accuracy.

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:49.080


01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:54.240
So are we will kind of talk about is

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.090
floating point numbers which try to

01:08:58.090 --> 01:09:01.690
maintain insofar as possible a uniform

01:09:01.690 --> 01:09:02.330
precision.

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:09.380


01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:12.820
For any given number that they're

01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:16.310
representing an in the sense of kind of

01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:19.160
floating point really is scientific

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:19.660
notation.

01:09:21.210 --> 01:09:24.520
So its scientific computing course, and

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:27.030
one thing that we all learned, for

01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:28.990
example in chemistry, is just how

01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:30.816
important these scientific notation is.

01:09:30.816 --> 01:09:33.800
One we want to carry through a given.

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:37.370
Level of accuracy, specifically by

01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:38.720
scientific notation, I mean, we might

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:42.310
say that we have 2.103

01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:45.310
Moles per something, right?

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:47.320
So kind of much like you do in

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:47.720
chemistry.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:48.660
We do this calculations.

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:52.120
You tried to make a measurement which

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.940
gives you some amount of accuracy and

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.346
then you try to carry through

01:09:56.346 --> 01:09:58.440
calculations that done maintain that

01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:59.690
number of digits of accuracy.

01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:03.020
And what we're really doing there, and

01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:04.350
what would happen is that you might

01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:05.939
make a measurement, and you might

01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:06.840
measure something in liters.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.033
But then you might talk about something

01:10:08.033 --> 01:10:10.330
in terms of like moles, right where the

01:10:10.330 --> 01:10:12.000
exponent now is completely different,

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.523
so this might be 2.13 * 10 to 23, or 10

01:10:16.523 --> 01:10:17.536
to the minus 23.

01:10:17.536 --> 01:10:18.806
And that doesn't matter.

01:10:18.806 --> 01:10:20.390
We still have the same relative

01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:23.720
accuracy, so we still have kind of

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:26.100
error in this 4th 4th bit.

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:28.580
So in that sense, if it notation has

01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.330
uniform precision, no matter what the

01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:31.560
magnitude of the number is.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.260
So even if it's kind of some tiny

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:35.374
fraction talking about something at the

01:10:35.374 --> 01:10:37.905
scale of electrons or huge number,

01:10:37.905 --> 01:10:39.620
talking about something at the scale of

01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:40.610
galaxies.

01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:43.660
We can represent them all with the same

01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:45.850
type of notation and similarly floating

01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:48.510
point will essentially kind of provide

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.270
a way... provide a data structure for

01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:51.040
scientific notation.

01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:52.680


01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:56.550
Right and so.

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.640
Given x

01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.840
we'll say that the floating point

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.460
representation is FL of X.

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:08.040
And generally, for most choices of X

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.050
and will be precise about that soon.

01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:13.104
The relative error of this

01:11:13.104 --> 01:11:15.045
representation or the magnitude of the relative


01:11:15.045 --> 01:11:16.505
error to be precise.

01:11:16.505 --> 01:11:20.260
So FL of X -- X divided by kind of the

01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:22.939
right answer, which is just X, will be

01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:26.370
less than or equal to some fixed

01:11:26.370 --> 01:11:29.040
precision epsilon and will soon learn

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.348
that this epsilon, so the

01:11:32.348 --> 01:11:33.009
representation.

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:36.560
Error of our floating point system is

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:36.720
called.

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:38.820
Machine epsilon is kind of critical for

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:39.730
analysis of.

01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:43.550
The propagation of error due to

01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:44.970
floating point representation within

01:11:44.970 --> 01:11:45.690
computations.

01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:47.720


01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:49.810
So.

01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:52.600


01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:55.750
Floating point brings up I related

01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:58.290
notion which although in no means is

01:11:58.290 --> 01:12:00.330
restricted to floating point, which is

01:12:00.330 --> 01:12:01.560
propagated data error.

01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:03.170
So.

01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:07.760
Often were not given the true input X

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:09.570
to some degree, but some approximation

01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:10.830
of it so.

01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:13.750
We're given some X hat which is close

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:14.340
to axe.

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:18.410
And then we get the error F of X at

01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:19.350
minus F of X.

01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:23.280
So even if we compute exactly, we might

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.880
be computing it for a slightly

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.230
incorrect input.

01:12:26.230 --> 01:12:29.450
An example of this is maybe our input

01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:29.720
was.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:33.190
I'm measurement that we made by I on in

01:12:33.190 --> 01:12:35.440
chemistry using some kind of measure.

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:38.770
So there we had some error and then we

01:12:38.770 --> 01:12:40.160
ultimately input a number into the

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.780
computer, which is some approximation

01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:43.738
and that has some number of digits of

01:12:43.738 --> 01:12:43.999
accuracy.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.265
Everything beyond those digits of

01:12:45.265 --> 01:12:46.240
accuracy is garbage.

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:48.580
Maybe will claim with zero, but in fact

01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:49.760
we don't know anything about it.

01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:52.268
So that would be an example of

01:12:52.268 --> 01:12:53.690
propagated data error.

01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:56.160
Another kind of innocence.

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.797
We're thinking about propagated data

01:12:57.797 --> 01:12:58.090
error.

01:12:58.090 --> 01:12:59.780
Is that maybe we have some real numbers

01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:01.170
and as soon as we put them into

01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:03.530
computer we need to do FL of the real

01:13:03.530 --> 01:13:04.095
number right?

01:13:04.095 --> 01:13:06.016
So that will introduce a little bit of

01:13:06.016 --> 01:13:07.905
floating point error and that's kind of

01:13:07.905 --> 01:13:09.770
error to our original input and we

01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:11.300
could ask how that propagates.

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:13.400
But floating Point will then also

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.308
perhaps cause further errors during the

01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:17.385
computation, and we can then maybe need

01:13:17.385 --> 01:13:18.990
to think about how those propagate

01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:19.740
throughout the computation.

01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:22.280


01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:28.250
But in general will be focused on two

01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:31.040
types of error, so kind of if we

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.710
consider the computed out of X versus

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:36.710
the true F of X, the error the main

01:13:36.710 --> 01:13:39.200
sources of error are rounding error,

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:41.930
which is errors due to floating point.

01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:45.470
Anne truncation error, which is errors

01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:48.530
due to approximating F.

01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:51.090
Without that.

01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:56.330


01:13:58.050 --> 01:13:59.940
So in a sense, this is due to using

01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:02.410
some approximate algorithm.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.750
One example is that instead of

01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:07.030
computing a function, we might compute

01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:09.810
a Taylor expansion, which is accurate

01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:12.230
to in some sense.

01:14:13.710 --> 01:14:16.350
And so whenever we then kind of make

01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:19.660
approximation to a function and try to

01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:21.036
compute the result and compare it to

01:14:21.036 --> 01:14:23.280
the true solution, this will refer to

01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.420
as a truncation error.

01:14:25.230 --> 01:14:28.540
So in that sense, this is method versus

01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:30.560
the true solution, assuming the method

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:34.127
is computed with exact arithmetic in

01:14:34.127 --> 01:14:37.040
exact arithmetic, is a common phrase

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.963
and kind of medical analysis to say

01:14:38.963 --> 01:14:41.405
without the use of floating point, that

01:14:41.405 --> 01:14:43.730
is without rounding error.

01:14:46.050 --> 01:14:47.700
So again, a rounding error being.

01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:51.320
A fellow X -- X right there.

01:14:52.370 --> 01:14:55.860
Let's see I miss any questions on this

01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:56.440
chat.

01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:57.860
Not yet.

01:14:59.610 --> 01:15:01.350
OK, so these are the basic sources of

01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:03.485
error that will analyze any questions

01:15:03.485 --> 01:15:04.120
so far.

01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:11.700
OK, let's continue.

01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:16.750
So forward error.

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:17.710
We've already talked about.

01:15:17.710 --> 01:15:21.090
A little bit will be the.

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.300
Error in what we compute, so this is

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:27.440
kind of again app out of X -- F of X.

01:15:28.410 --> 01:15:29.090


01:15:31.530 --> 01:15:33.280
But a different notion that is

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.440
important in the medical analysis and

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:38.790
often can be used to bound the error

01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:40.360
when there's not a bounding forward

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.940
error or to obtain a better bound is a

01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:44.250
notion of backward error.

01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:48.750
So with backward error, what we're

01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:50.970
actually going to ask is.

01:15:51.690 --> 01:15:53.190
So suppose we computed.

01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:54.740


01:15:58.150 --> 01:16:01.150
Out parallax, so really we took an

01:16:01.150 --> 01:16:03.230
input and we computed the wrong thing,

01:16:03.230 --> 01:16:06.440
but did we compute the right answer for

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:07.730
some perturbed input?

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:09.130
So.

01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:13.990
Is there some?

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:15.530
Ex, hab.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:17.740
For which.

01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:20.470
F of X hat.

01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:23.619
So the true function applied to X hat

01:16:23.620 --> 01:16:25.920
is equal to a FedEx.

01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.810


01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:30.070
And if so.

01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:33.400
X hat minus X is.

01:16:34.710 --> 01:16:35.370


01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:38.420
Our backward air.

01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:44.940
So this is saying that.

01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:48.480
We actually computed the true solution

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.920
to a slightly perturbed problem.

01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:53.750
And this is in a sense, a certification

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:56.550
that we computed this equality because

01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:59.030
typically what were given as input has

01:16:59.030 --> 01:17:01.360
some degree of inaccuracy, right?

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.940
So we talked about this data

01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:04.053
propagation error.

01:17:04.053 --> 01:17:05.915
So for example, it could be a.

01:17:05.915 --> 01:17:08.220
So if we can derive a backward error

01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:08.950
bound that says.

01:17:11.130 --> 01:17:13.060
We've got so many digits of accuracy

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:14.710
for this type of input.

01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:18.874
In now, in the sense that the digits of

01:17:18.874 --> 01:17:21.320
accuracy are digits of accuracy on your

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:23.390
input, so kind of.

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:26.780
We might have computed the solution to

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:30.150
an input that was kind of erroneous in

01:17:30.150 --> 01:17:31.709
the 4th digit, so a 4th digit

01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:32.868
perturbation to your input would have

01:17:32.868 --> 01:17:34.040
given would have given the result that

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:34.480
you compute.

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.240
And this type of analysis can be useful

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:40.780
in demonstrating that the error small.

01:17:42.130 --> 01:17:45.280
There's a good picture to kind of keep

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:47.512
track of what's going on, which I have

01:17:47.512 --> 01:17:50.780
here, so we start with kind of some

01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:51.855
true value X.

01:17:51.855 --> 01:17:54.100
We compute the true up of X, so that's

01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:56.416
here, and so the difference between F

01:17:56.416 --> 01:17:59.850
of X and the head of X, which is our

01:17:59.850 --> 01:18:03.030
kind of inaccurate algorithm for this

01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:06.330
problem, it is going to be the forward

01:18:06.330 --> 01:18:07.240
error.

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:09.871
However, if we can also find an X hat

01:18:09.871 --> 01:18:12.739
for which the true F applied to X hat.

01:18:12.820 --> 01:18:14.219
Is equal to?

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:15.120
How to vex?

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.190
So the main equation to keep in mind

01:18:17.190 --> 01:18:20.132
here being apart of X need to equal X

01:18:20.132 --> 01:18:24.320
hat, then X -- X hat is our backward

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:24.630
error.

01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:27.980
So typically done in the medical

01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:30.840
analysis one we want to show that an

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:35.229
algorithm is stable, which is typically

01:18:35.230 --> 01:18:38.420
implies that the algorithm does not

01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:40.310
have too much forward air or backward

01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.730
error.

01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:45.340
Which can be analyzed, kind of in a

01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:46.680
perturbative way, or.

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.640
Somewhat differently, depending on the

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:51.420
exact setting, but generally we're

01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:52.900
looking to bound one of these two types

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.740
of errors as a way to certify the fact

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:55.960
that our algorithms computing right

01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:56.090
now.

01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.730
OK.

01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:03.070
Any questions about decorator?

01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:18.390
I think there is a question.

01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:19.900
So one question is what is the

01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:21.770
difference between these two values?

01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:25.850
So here this is, we've applied.

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:30.180
A different function to the true input,

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:31.210
so here kind of.

01:19:31.870 --> 01:19:34.200
I've had this some approximation of F.

01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:37.630
And here we apply computed the true

01:19:37.630 --> 01:19:39.540
function on a perturbed input.

01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:42.120
So here ex had some approximation or is

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:43.030
nearby X.

01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:44.480


01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:46.380
Yeah.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.030
OK, great any other questions.

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.560
Right, so one question.

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.030
Is this actually always true?

01:19:58.030 --> 01:20:00.250
Yeah, so.

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:04.640
To bond the backward error, we need to

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.250
be able to find something like this,

01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:08.090
but whether we're actually able to is a

01:20:08.090 --> 01:20:08.650
different question.

01:20:08.650 --> 01:20:09.960
It could be that such an accident does

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:12.945
not exist, and we might not have an

01:20:12.945 --> 01:20:14.070
error bound in that case.

01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:18.130
But for in many cases, especially in

01:20:18.130 --> 01:20:20.770
linear algebra, when there is kind of

01:20:20.770 --> 01:20:24.370
in a sense of 1 to one mapping, one can

01:20:24.370 --> 01:20:27.890
guarantee that the session had exists

01:20:27.890 --> 01:20:29.870
and that it's not too far away, and so

01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:31.140
your backward error is nice and

01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:34.810
bounded, but it's certainly not going

01:20:34.810 --> 01:20:36.420
to be always true for an arbitrary

01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:36.710
problem.

01:20:38.210 --> 01:20:39.490
Good question as well.

01:20:40.450 --> 01:20:40.840
OK.

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:45.060
Feel free to post more questions.

01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:46.910
But let's go.

01:20:47.630 --> 01:20:53.830
OK, so the other one important notion

01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:56.510
that relating to error.

01:20:58.460 --> 01:20:59.500
That's kind of a function of the

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:02.330
problem and not the actual algorithm is

01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:02.890
condition.

01:21:03.970 --> 01:21:06.760
And let me emphasize that this is a

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:10.120
function of a problem, so if I'm not up

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:10.410
yet.

01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:15.350
So the condition number is a measure of

01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:17.760
how much a perturbation to the input

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.880
can be amplified.

01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:25.850
Once we actually compute F so.

01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:28.790
In particular, if we consider the

01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:31.730
absolute condition number, so say Kappa

01:21:31.730 --> 01:21:32.950
of F.

01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:37.770
And let's also say of F for the input

01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:38.240
X.

01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:39.860
So.

01:21:41.410 --> 01:21:44.990
That will be the limit of some

01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:47.310
perturbation Delta X.

01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:51.330
Going to zero out of.

01:21:52.330 --> 01:21:54.260
F of X plus Delta X.

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:58.600
Minus F of X divided by Delta X.

01:22:00.730 --> 01:22:01.410


01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:03.390
There's a question going back to back

01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:06.580
with error regarding how to calculate X

01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:07.220
hat.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:10.170
So.

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:13.080
Typically what you could do, for

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:14.600
example is.

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:16.090
Well, one way is you could if he could

01:22:16.090 --> 01:22:18.530
bond the forward error and that

01:22:18.530 --> 01:22:19.310
innocence.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.610
Is the difference that you need to?

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.720
Kind of compute.

01:22:26.410 --> 01:22:28.580
So you can adjust the input to take

01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:30.220
that into account, and this is easy.

01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:31.834
If, for example, we are computing a

01:22:31.834 --> 01:22:33.635
linear function, so then we could say

01:22:33.635 --> 01:22:34.860
we have this difference.

01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:36.590
So we just need to increase our input

01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:37.840
by that amount and we can directly

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:38.370
compute it.

01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:39.862
And this is a function of.

01:22:39.862 --> 01:22:41.240
This is due to the function being

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:44.460
linear, but if it's not then this is no

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:46.080
longer guaranteed in the sense we need

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:48.280
to apply the reciprocal of the

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:48.520
function.

01:22:49.930 --> 01:22:52.710
But typically we will kind of show that

01:22:52.710 --> 01:22:54.913
there exists some perturbation to the

01:22:54.913 --> 01:22:56.627
input for which what we've computed is

01:22:56.627 --> 01:22:57.340
actually correct.

01:22:57.340 --> 01:23:00.190
One reason that this might help is that

01:23:00.190 --> 01:23:02.950
if the source of error in our

01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:04.905
truncation error of our algorithm is

01:23:04.905 --> 01:23:07.346
actually due to some change in the

01:23:07.346 --> 01:23:09.310
input or something we computed, we can

01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:11.098
kind of model that as a change in the

01:23:11.098 --> 01:23:11.310
input.

01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:14.550
It could be that our algorithm starts

01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:16.630
by just approximating the input and

01:23:16.630 --> 01:23:17.642
then computing something.

01:23:17.642 --> 01:23:19.200
Then I just have a simple bound in the

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:20.190
backward error, right?

01:23:20.190 --> 01:23:22.930
So we've actually computed look at that

01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:24.760
first approximation, and I say actually

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:26.990
changed X by a little bit, and so this

01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:28.520
changes the result.

01:23:29.890 --> 01:23:32.750
Yeah, there's lots of other questions.

01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:33.930
Let me try to keep up with everything.

01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:37.210
Is there any example of that we need to

01:23:37.210 --> 01:23:38.360
compute backward error?

01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:41.380
Not exactly sure I understand the

01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:41.750
question.

01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:47.030
So.

01:23:48.450 --> 01:23:50.430
Typically we would be interested in

01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:52.330
bounding backward error, so we don't

01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:54.560
necessarily want to compute what with.

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.760
The error is for a particular input, we

01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:00.536
want to just say that for any input in

01:24:00.536 --> 01:24:04.490
this domain are what we would compute.

01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:06.636
It will be close to the true solution

01:24:06.636 --> 01:24:10.042
in the sense that we will have computed

01:24:10.042 --> 01:24:11.630
something for a slightly perturbed

01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:12.646
problem, typically.

01:24:12.646 --> 01:24:15.200
So typically this is not something we

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:17.140
kind of computing the program, but do

01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:19.070
offline and theoretical analysis.

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:20.740
So perhaps that.

01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:23.460
Answer the question, but let me know if

01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:24.270
it does not quite.

01:24:26.010 --> 01:24:27.820
But if there's multiple X hats that

01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:28.940
satisfy the condition.

01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:36.390
It's somewhat context dependent.

01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:40.986
If that's actually the case, we often

01:24:40.986 --> 01:24:42.330
not really be interested in the

01:24:42.330 --> 01:24:44.110
backward error analysis or not be doing

01:24:44.110 --> 01:24:44.500
it.

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:46.510
So again, like this often will be done

01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:48.000
in linear algebra when you have a

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.580
linear mapping, but.

01:24:52.190 --> 01:24:54.940
So you could you might be interested in

01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:56.830
just showing that there exists an X hat

01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:59.250
that's kind of close by and that would

01:24:59.250 --> 01:25:00.542
suffice for a certification.

01:25:00.542 --> 01:25:03.730
That kind of the answer is accurate, so

01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:05.630
I guess typically it is showing that

01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:07.770
one exists, but in most contexts only

01:25:07.770 --> 01:25:10.930
one will exist, at least in the context

01:25:10.930 --> 01:25:11.750
of what we want to do.

01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:12.950
That for stability analysis.

01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:18.370
How do we know errors due to Exeter?

01:25:18.370 --> 01:25:20.330
I've had given that there is an error.

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.202
Right, so in reality, when computing

01:25:24.202 --> 01:25:25.692
you don't really know, right?

01:25:25.692 --> 01:25:28.975
So you get some error and you're not

01:25:28.975 --> 01:25:30.720
really sure that's why we kind of need

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.540
to go back and potentially do analysis

01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:34.050
and understand what are the different

01:25:34.050 --> 01:25:36.492
sources of error, but kind of when

01:25:36.492 --> 01:25:37.100
actually computing stuff.

01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:38.700
Everything looks alike and there was

01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:40.036
general the only way you would actually

01:25:40.036 --> 01:25:41.990
get a backward error is if you could

01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:43.830
apply like the inverse of the function

01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:45.780
exactly.

01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:47.340
Then you would be able to get like a

01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:48.290
concrete X hat.

01:25:48.290 --> 01:25:50.600
That's often not the case, although

01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:52.260
perhaps if we're kind of testing an

01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:52.880
algorithm.

01:25:53.050 --> 01:25:55.580
They were testing algorithm for solving

01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:57.030
a linear system of equations.

01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:58.950
If we had an exact algorithm for

01:25:58.950 --> 01:26:01.808
computing matrix vector product then we

01:26:01.808 --> 01:26:05.620
could compute given some solution X hat

01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:08.486
that's approximate to ax equals B.

01:26:08.486 --> 01:26:12.000
We could compute a * X hat and that

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.980
will give us a baby hat and then we can

01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:15.577
look at the difference between B&amp;B had

01:26:15.577 --> 01:26:17.250
to estimate the backward error.

01:26:17.250 --> 01:26:19.609
So that's one common example of 1.

01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:20.670
This is actually computable.

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:22.510


01:26:25.670 --> 01:26:27.170
Right and then I'm getting lots of

01:26:27.170 --> 01:26:27.540
condition.

01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:29.560
Number of questions that I think are

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:32.230
going to answer in a second anyway.

01:26:33.170 --> 01:26:33.820


01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:37.070
Right, so this Delta is nothing to do

01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:39.910
with the Dirac Delta, so if you like we

01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:41.540
can switch notation.

01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:43.780
And use.

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.910
The step of Delta X.

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:47.980
Although that doctor can also be

01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:49.220
confused about those things.

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:56.110
Right, and so indeed this is simply.

01:26:57.100 --> 01:26:59.770
A prime of X the derivative at X.

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:02.620
And so let's.

01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:06.988
And I will talk about this condition

01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:08.700
number in the condition of our matrix

01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:10.030
shortly.

01:27:10.030 --> 01:27:11.170
So in particular, the relative

01:27:11.170 --> 01:27:12.160
condition number.

01:27:14.350 --> 01:27:16.280
Will be related to the Matrix

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:18.240
condition, number matrix condition

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:18.730
number.

01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:20.140
Is.

01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:23.200
Kind of a special thing because we just

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:24.826
say that this is a condition number of

01:27:24.826 --> 01:27:26.140
matrix, but conditioning you should

01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:27.928
think about this is the conditioning of

01:27:27.928 --> 01:27:28.810
a problem.

01:27:28.810 --> 01:27:30.743
So for example, I might ask you what

01:27:30.743 --> 01:27:32.029
the conditioning of matrix vector

01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:33.693
product is with respect to

01:27:33.693 --> 01:27:34.954
perturbations in input X.

01:27:34.954 --> 01:27:36.790
So the vector that we're multiplying by

01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:38.564
where I might ask you what is the

01:27:38.564 --> 01:27:40.862
conditioning of the linear system with

01:27:40.862 --> 01:27:44.480
respect to perturbations to the right

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:46.850
hand side we had in both cases.

01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:48.780
Actually the answer will be that the

01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:51.080
conditioning conditioning is the matrix

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:52.000
condition number.

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:53.803
So the matrix condition number is kind

01:27:53.803 --> 01:27:54.620
of the salute.

01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:57.485
The right conditioning bound for a

01:27:57.485 --> 01:27:59.910
number of important linear algebra

01:27:59.910 --> 01:28:02.825
problems, and we'll talk about that in

01:28:02.825 --> 01:28:03.750
a lot of detail.

01:28:05.210 --> 01:28:06.310
In a lecture or two.

01:28:08.570 --> 01:28:09.280
Pump pump.

01:28:16.930 --> 01:28:18.640
OK, I think I've answered most of the

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:19.470
questions.

01:28:19.470 --> 01:28:21.130
Let's perhaps go on a little bit and

01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:22.920
talk and kind of define the condition

01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:25.010
number and stop there for today.

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:27.870
So let's talk a little bit about the

01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:29.310
intuition of what's going on here.

01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:33.940
So we're kind of saying that.

01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:36.880
Suppose we have some function F.

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:38.320


01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:40.260
And.

01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:43.220
No, maybe it's not changing too much.

01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:45.000
And then maybe all of a suddenly

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.950
changes a lot and then maybe not too

01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:47.440
much again.

01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:50.400
So if I look.

01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:54.500
And say OK, maybe access here.

01:28:55.570 --> 01:28:57.550
Then if I change XA little bit.

01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:00.130
So by Delta X.

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:01.740


01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:05.510
App will not change too much right?

01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:08.840
So in that sense, at this point F as.

01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:15.020
If I look over here and if X happens to

01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:17.060
be here, and if I change it slightly,

01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:18.900
then up of exchange is drastically so.

01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:20.680
In that sense we have an ill

01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:21.570
conditioned problem.

01:29:21.570 --> 01:29:25.316
So here is we would say ill

01:29:25.316 --> 01:29:25.649
conditioned.

01:29:27.090 --> 01:29:28.560
More generally.

01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:32.535
We might say that the condition number

01:29:32.535 --> 01:29:37.240
of F is given as the maximum of over X.

01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:40.900
In some domain so.

01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:44.460
Let's say our domain is the real

01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:44.960
numbers.

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:46.650
Of this

01:29:48.370 --> 01:29:49.470
Kappa Alpha vax

01:29:50.850 --> 01:29:51.780
So of all this stuff.

01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:54.110
So generally we want to consider the

01:29:54.110 --> 01:29:55.960
maximum possible amplification over a

01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:57.840
set of inputs and so for example, for

01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:59.390
the matrix condition number there must

01:29:59.390 --> 01:29:59.770
be that.

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:03.160
OK.

01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:06.550
And then for the relative condition

01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:09.650
number, we now simply want to say that

01:30:09.650 --> 01:30:12.470
Kappa F of X will be.

01:30:13.090 --> 01:30:16.500
In a limit of kind of reprobation going

01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:17.270
to 0.

01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:19.210
And now we look.

01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:24.490
Not at the absolute error, but at the

01:30:24.490 --> 01:30:25.780
relative error.

01:30:27.690 --> 01:30:30.630
And similarly for the perturbation, we

01:30:30.630 --> 01:30:32.920
consider it to be a relative

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.430
perturbation in terms of magnitude.

01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:37.410
So now we have relative perturbation in

01:30:37.410 --> 01:30:39.739
output divided by relative perturbation

01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:41.760
input and again.

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:44.720
So maybe this one will Kappa abs.

01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:50.980
So our cap here for F over some domain

01:30:50.980 --> 01:30:54.696
will be again the maximum of over X and

01:30:54.696 --> 01:30:57.120
some domain, let's call it denial of

01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.020
Kappa of.

01:30:58.630 --> 01:31:00.920
F of X and so this relative condition

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:02.793
number will primarily be the condition

01:31:02.793 --> 01:31:04.160
number we're interested in just

01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:06.112
relative error is primarily the error

01:31:06.112 --> 01:31:07.660
we're actually interested in practice.

01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:08.990


01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:11.410
Right, and so this kind of conditioning

01:31:11.410 --> 01:31:12.810
is something that will now study for

01:31:12.810 --> 01:31:15.426
every problem that we will consider an

01:31:15.426 --> 01:31:17.810
will innocence, quantify how difficult

01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:19.950
it is to contain an accurate answer to

01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:22.930
a particular problem, and just how much

01:31:22.930 --> 01:31:25.510
we can get perturbed in the solution.

01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:27.123
If the input is slightly wrong.

01:31:27.123 --> 01:31:30.370
So if the problem is really badly

01:31:30.370 --> 01:31:31.780
conditioned, it becomes kind of

01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:33.453
incomputable and actually formally.

01:31:33.453 --> 01:31:35.145
If the condition number goes to

01:31:35.145 --> 01:31:36.940
Infinity then innocence F is

01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:37.720
discontinuous.

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:39.580
So right that the derivative is

01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:40.010
Infinity.

01:31:40.250 --> 01:31:41.730
And in that sense, the problem is built

01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:42.110
post.

01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:45.490
OK, so with that I will stop.

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:50.040
And perhaps I'm still happy to answer

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:52.610
some questions, but we should stop an

01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:53.240
interesting time.

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:57.310
Is there any assignments or quizzes you

01:31:57.310 --> 01:31:57.895
after this class?

01:31:57.895 --> 01:32:00.200
There is a quiz for you all do for next

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:01.980
Wednesday by the start of class, which

01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:03.360
is just about the course policies.

01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:06.600
So please complete that and keep an eye

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:09.430
out for further assignments on the web

01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:10.760
page an on Piazza.

01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:12.970
And again, office hours will post

01:32:12.970 --> 01:32:15.110
shortly after class this afternoon.

01:32:16.670 --> 01:32:17.360
Thanks for trying.

01:32:21.020 --> 01:32:21.910
Yes, this Wednesday.

01:32:23.570 --> 01:32:25.140
To order this class.

01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:30.830
In the past I've had to sign a form, I

01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:33.290
presume like now that's more like an

01:32:33.290 --> 01:32:34.080
email.

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:35.160
Actually, I'm not sure.

01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:37.160
But it should be possible.

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:40.730
There was a question of why do we take

01:32:40.730 --> 01:32:41.940
a Max over D.

01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:44.390
So in general we want to consider

01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:46.660
maximizing over the input domain, so

01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:48.610
for whatever actually want to consider

01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:50.082
what is the condition number.

01:32:50.082 --> 01:32:52.189
So for the matrix condition number, for

01:32:52.190 --> 01:32:53.910
example, we want to consider perhaps

01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:55.040
any non 0X.

01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:58.330
Might be a reasonable input, but in

01:32:58.330 --> 01:32:59.540
some other cases maybe you want to

01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:01.250
restrict X to be from some vector

01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:01.800
space.

01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:04.430
Or maybe we have a particular kind of

01:33:04.430 --> 01:33:05.850
interval on the real line.

01:33:05.850 --> 01:33:07.720
All of those are reasonable inputs.

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:13.800
Absolute value certainly could have

01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:14.550
been missed.

01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:16.010
Yeah, we probably should have.

01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:27.770
In general, the condition number is a

01:33:27.770 --> 01:33:28.630
positive number.

01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:30.040
So.

01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:33.160
It doesn't hurt to take absolute values

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:33.550
everywhere.

01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:42.610
Thanks for the correction.
